# 1. Define 10 cities with (x, y) coordinates
# This is the classical input data for the problem.

# 2. Compute distance matrix (classical preprocessing)
# A classical computer performs this initial calculation.

# 3. Set up TSP as a Quadratic Program (QUBO)

# The `QuadraticProgramToQubo` class handles this conversion correctly.

# A standard approach is to combine the distance objective and the tour constraints
# into a single QUBO objective function with penalty terms.
# The penalty weight 'M' should be large enough to enforce the constraints.

# 2. Add penalties for each city being visited more than once or not at all.
# This penalty is (sum(x_i_j over j) - 1)^2 for each city i.

# 3. Add penalties for each tour position having more than one city.
# This penalty is (sum(x_i_j over i) - 1)^2 for each position j.
for j in range(n):
    for i in range(n):
        objective_terms[(f"x_{i}_{j}", f"x_{i}_{j}")] = objective_terms.get((f"x_{i}_{j}", f"x_{i}_{j}"), 0) + M

# Minimize the objective function.
qp.minimize(quadratic=objective_terms)

# -------------------------------
# 4. Solve using QAOA (quantum) + COBYLA optimizer
# The MinimumEigenOptimizer correctly handles the problem internally.
seed = 123

# The QAOA class now takes a sampler from qiskit_aer.primitives
qaoa_sampler = Sampler()

# Initialize the QAOA algorithm with a sampler and a classical optimizer.
qaoa = QAOA(
    optimizer=COBYLA(maxiter=200),
    sampler=qaoa_sampler,
    reps=1,
)

# Use MinimumEigenOptimizer to find the solution.
# This wrapper handles the conversion from the QUBO to the Ising model automatically.
optimizer = MinimumEigenOptimizer(qaoa)
result = optimizer.solve(qp)

# -------------------------------
# 5. Print results
print("Optimal TSP route (binary vars):")
print(result.x)
print("Minimum distance (objective value):", result.fval)

# -------------------------------
# Hackathon talking point:
# "In this demo, we use 10 cities to show the algorithm running.
# In reality, using hybrid clustering and decomposition techniques,
# this approach could scale to 20â€“50 cities on classical+quantum hybrid systems."
