## Overview of Classical VRP

### What is the Vehicle Routing Problem?

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that seeks to determine the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers. It is a generalization of the famous Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

### Problem Characteristics

- **NP-Hard Complexity**: The VRP belongs to the class of NP-hard problems, meaning no polynomial-time algorithm is known for finding optimal solutions
- **Combinatorial Explosion**: For n customers, there are approximately (n!)²/n possible solutions
- **Multi-Objective**: Typically optimizes for distance, time, cost, or vehicle utilization
- **Real-World Constraints**: Involves practical limitations like vehicle capacity, time windows, and geographical constraints

## Problem Definition & Mathematical Formulation

### Core Components

#### 1. **Locations**
```rust
// Core data structure from types.rs
Location {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    coordinate: Coordinate,
    demand: f64,
    time_window: Option<TimeWindow>,
    service_time: f64,
}
```

#### 2. **Vehicles**
```rust
Vehicle {
    id: u32,
    capacity: f64,
    max_distance: Option<f64>,
    max_duration: Option<f64>,
    depot_id: u32,
}
```

#### 3. **Mathematical Objective**
- **Primary Objective**: Minimize total distance traveled
- **Secondary Objectives**: Minimize number of vehicles used, minimize total duration
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: All customers must be served while respecting vehicle capacities and operational constraints

### Constraint Types

1. **Capacity Constraints**: `∑(demand_i) ≤ vehicle_capacity` for each route
2. **Distance Constraints**: `route_distance ≤ max_distance` for each vehicle
3. **Duration Constraints**: `route_duration ≤ max_duration` for each vehicle
4. **Service Time**: Fixed time spent at each customer location
5. **Time Windows** (future): Customer availability windows

## Classical Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Greedy Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

#### Algorithm Description
A constructive heuristic that builds routes by always choosing the nearest unvisited customer.

#### Implementation Variants
- **Nearest Start**: Begin with closest customer to depot
- **Farthest Start**: Begin with farthest customer to depot (for better coverage)

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) where n = number of customers
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
- **Execution Speed**: 0.0658ms for 3 customers (ultra-fast)
- **Solution Quality**: Good for small instances, may be suboptimal for larger problems

#### Algorithm Steps
1. Start at depot
2. Select nearest unvisited customer
3. Move to selected customer
4. Repeat until all customers visited or vehicle capacity/constraints exceeded
5. Return to depot
6. Start new route if customers remain and vehicles available

#### Use Cases
- **Small Problems**: <20 customers where speed is prioritized
- **Initial Solutions**: Providing starting points for metaheuristics
- **Real-time Applications**: When sub-second response times required

### 2. Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm

#### Algorithm Description
A classical VRP algorithm developed by Clarke and Wright (1964) that improves upon initial radial routes by merging routes based on distance savings.

#### Mathematical Foundation
**Savings Formula**: `S(i,j) = d(0,i) + d(0,j) - d(i,j)`
Where:
- `d(0,i)` = distance from depot to customer i
- `d(0,j)` = distance from depot to customer j  
- `d(i,j)` = distance between customers i and j

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Time Complexity**: O(n² log n) due to sorting savings
- **Space Complexity**: O(n²) for savings matrix
- **Execution Speed**: 1.332ms for 3 customers
- **Solution Quality**: Better than greedy for medium-sized problems

#### Algorithm Steps
1. Create initial solution: separate route for each customer (depot → customer → depot)
2. Calculate savings S(i,j) for all customer pairs
3. Sort savings in descending order
4. For each savings pair (i,j):
   - Check if routes containing i and j can be merged
   - Verify capacity and other constraints
   - Merge routes if feasible and beneficial
5. Return optimized solution

#### Use Cases
- **Medium Problems**: 20-50 customers where quality balance is needed
- **Academic Research**: Baseline algorithm for comparison studies
- **Educational Purposes**: Demonstrates savings-based optimization principles

### 3. Multi-Start Metaheuristic

#### Algorithm Description
An ensemble approach that runs multiple algorithms and selects the best solution found.

#### Implementation Strategy
```rust
// Executes all available algorithms in parallel
MultiStartSolver::new()
    .with_default_solvers()
    .solve(&instance)
```

#### Included Algorithms
- Greedy Nearest Neighbor (nearest start)
- Greedy Nearest Neighbor (farthest start)  
- Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Time Complexity**: O(max(algorithm_complexities))
- **Execution Speed**: 1.3773ms for 3 customers
- **Solution Quality**: Best among all implemented methods
- **Reliability**: Reduces risk of poor solutions through diversification

#### Use Cases
- **Quality-Critical Applications**: When optimal/near-optimal solutions required
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Benchmarking different approaches
- **Production Systems**: When computational time allows for best results

## Distance Calculation Methods

### 1. Haversine Distance (Great Circle Distance)

#### Mathematical Formula
```
a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos φ1 ⋅ cos φ2 ⋅ sin²(Δλ/2)
c = 2 ⋅ atan2(√a, √(1−a))
d = R ⋅ c
```
Where:
- φ = latitude in radians
- λ = longitude in radians  
- R = Earth's radius (6,371 km)

#### Implementation
```rust
// Most accurate for geographic coordinates
DistanceMethod::Haversine
```

#### Use Cases
- **Real-world routing**: Most accurate for lat/lon coordinates
- **Global applications**: Works across all geographic regions
- **Research applications**: Standard for VRP geographic studies

### 2. Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm)

#### Mathematical Formula
```
d = |x₁ - x₂| + |y₁ - y₂|
```

#### Characteristics
- **Grid-based routing**: Suitable for urban environments with grid layouts
- **Computational efficiency**: Faster than Haversine
- **Approximation accuracy**: Good for rectangular coordinate systems

### 3. Euclidean Distance (L2 Norm)

#### Mathematical Formula
```
d = √[(x₁ - x₂)² + (y₁ - y₂)²]
```

#### Characteristics
- **Theoretical studies**: Standard for academic VRP research
- **Benchmark problems**: Used in VRP literature and competitions
- **Computational simplicity**: Fast calculation for large datasets

    route.total_demand <= vehicle.capacity
}
```

#### Validation Logic

### 2. Distance and Duration Limits

#### Distance Constraints
```rust
max_distance: Option<f64>  // Maximum meters per vehicle
```

#### Duration Constraints  
```rust
max_duration: Option<f64>  // Maximum seconds per vehicle
```

#### Speed Modeling
- **Default Speed**: 15 m/s (54 km/h) for realistic time estimates
- **Service Time**: Fixed time at each customer location (default: 300s/5min)
- **Total Duration**: `driving_time + (num_customers × service_time)`

### 3. Geographic Constraints

#### Real-World Coordinate Mapping
- **OSM Integration**: Maps target coordinates to nearest road intersections
- **Accuracy**: Typically 26-45 meters from original coordinates
- **Road Network Compliance**: Ensures routes follow actual streets

#### Coordinate Validation
```rust
// Geographic bounds checking
pub fn validate_coordinates(lat: f64, lon: f64) -> bool {
    lat >= -90.0 && lat <= 90.0 && lon >= -180.0 && lon <= 180.0
}
```
